# The Island

On this page you'll see the map of the island.

It's divided into a number of regions. You can click on a region to see information about it - most importantly, the number of encounters it will take to conquer it, and the reward you'll get for doing so.

When you're ready to start an encounter, select the region you want to attack. Initially you'll have to choose a region on the coast, but once you control a region, you can attack any neighboring region.

To begin the encounter, click the `Start An Encounter Here` button, and you'll be asked to choose which of your heroes are going to take part (you can choose up to five heroes). Once you've made your selection, press `Start the Encounter`.
