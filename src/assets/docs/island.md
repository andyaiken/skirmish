# The Island

On this page you'll see the map of the island.

It's divided into a number of regions. You can click on a region to see information about it - most importantly, the number of encounters it will take to conquer it, the sorts of monsters you can expect to face, and the reward you'll get for doing so.

When you're ready to start an encounter, select the region you want to attack. You can attack any neighboring region.

To begin the encounter, click the `Start An Encounter` button, and you'll be asked to choose which of your heroes are going to take part (you can choose up to five heroes). Once you've made your selection, press `Start the Encounter`.
