# Your Equipment

This page shows you all the equipment you've gathered during the course of your campaign.

Initially there'll be nothing here, but when you win an encounter you'll get all of your opponents' equipment, plus anything else that was lying around the battlefield.

You can sell any magic items you don't want for 50 money each.
You can sell any non-magic items you don't want for 1 money each.

## Money

The right-hand column shows how much money your heroes have. Once you control part of the island, you can use this money to buy a magic item. You'll be given a choice of three item cards, from which you can pick one, at a cost of 100 money.

## Item Rewards

The right-hand column will list any reward cards you've recieved from conquered map regions. Select the reward card to redeem the reward.

* **Magic Item**: This reward gives you a particular magic item.
* **Money**: This reward grants you extra money.
