# Skirmish

Skirmish is a tactical battle game in which the object is to beat your opponents in a series of encounters and gain control of an island.

As you control more and more of the island your heroes will get more powerful, and you'll pick up allies and magic items which will help you in your encounters.

If this is your first time playing Skirmish, you should start a new campaign.

Otherwise, you can continue your campaign from where you left off.

Good luck!
