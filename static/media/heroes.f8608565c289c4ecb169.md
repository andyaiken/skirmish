# Your Heroes

This page is where you'll find your heroes.

When you start a campaign, you'll see that you have several blank hero cards: click on them to create your heroes.

## Building a Hero

Building a hero is simple, and has only three steps:

* **Choosing species, role, and background**: Three species cards, three role cards, and three background cards will be drawn for you; pick one card from each row.
* **Choosing equipment**: For every proficiency your hero has, three item cards will be drawn for you; pick one card from each row.
* **Choose a name**: Click the `Rename this Hero` button until you're happy with your new hero's name.

## The Character Sheet

When you've built your character, you can click on their hero card to see their character sheet, which has two tabs:

* The `Statistics` tab shows your hero's statistics, and also shows the hero's decks of feature cards and action cards.
* The `Equipment` tab shows the items your hero is wielding or carrying.

Let's take a closer look at the contents of the `Statistics` tab.

* **Traits**: Traits are very important: they're your defenses against attacks, but they also have other functions. When damage is dealt to a hero, Endurance is used to prevent that damage turning into a wound, which is more serious. Resolve governs the number of wounds a hero can suffer before becoming unconscious. Speed is used to determine how far a hero can move every round.
* **Skills**: Some skills are used to make attacks (Brawl, Spellcasting, and Weapon). Stealth is used to avoid detection, while Perception is used to foil it. Presence is used whenever a hero needs to exert their influence. Reactions is used to determine who acts first every round.
* **Proficiencies**: This list shows which items a hero is capable of using.
* **Auras**: Auras are effects which are applied to any allies or enemies who stand next to you in an encounter.
* **XP**: At the end of every successful encounter, each surviving hero gains 1 XP. Once a hero has enough XP, they can level up.
* **Damage Bonuses / Damage Resistances**: Many heroes, either through training or armor, have a certain amount of resistance to some damage types. Some have learned to deal additional damage when their attacks hit.
* **Feature Deck / Action Deck**: These decks are built from the hero's species, role, and background. The feature deck is used when the hero can level up; the action deck is used in an encounter when it is the hero's turn.

## Levelling Up

When a hero has gained enough XP to level up, three cards are drawn from their feature deck. Choose one of these cards; it will be applied to the hero.

## Hero Rewards

The right-hand column will list any reward cards you've recieved from conquered map regions. Select the reward card to redeem the reward.

* **Extra Hero**: This reward gives you a blank hero card which you can use to create a new hero.
* **Level Up**: This reward allows you to choose a hero who will immediately gain enough XP to level up.
* **Bonus XP**: This reward allows you to choose a hero who will immediately gain this amount of XP.
