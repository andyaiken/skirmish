  * Apply 'ease movement' effects from auras
  * Apply 'prevent movement' effects from auras
  * If you are prone or hidden, movement point costs are x2

## Using an action

* Apply initial effects
* If attack:
  * If requires weapon, and Unreliable weapon, roll Unreliable; if 10 or over, attack ends
  * Otherwise, for each target:
    * Apply pre-attack effects
    * Roll attacker's attack skill vs target's trait
    * Bonus equal to allies adjacent to the target
    * Apply hit / miss effects
    * Apply post-attack effects

## Taking damage

* Roll damage rank, add attacker's damage bonus, add attacker's weapon damage bonus, subtract target's damage resistance
  * Apply 'damage vulnerability' / 'damage resistance' effects from auras
  * Add this to the targetâ€™s Damage
* If more than 0:
  * Roll target's Endurance; if result less than Damage, reset Damage to 0 and increment Wounds
  * If target's Wounds equals Resolve rank, unconscious; if target's Wounds greater than Resolve rank, dead
    * If dead, removed from the map; equipment lies in the square it fell in

## Healing

* Healing damage reduces target's Damage
* Healing wounds reduces target's Wounds
* If unconscious and Wounds reduced to below Resolve, prone
