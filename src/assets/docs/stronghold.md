# Your Stronghold

This page is where you'll find your stronghold.

You'll start your campaign with two **barracks** buildings, but as you progress you'll be able to buy more structures.

To buy a new structure, press the **Add Structure** button. You'll be given a choice of three structure cards, from which you can pick one, at a cost of 50 money.

## Stronghold Rewards

The right-hand column will list any reward cards you've recieved from conquered map regions. Select the reward card to redeem the reward.

* **Structure**: This reward gives you a new structure to add to your stronghold.
